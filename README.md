Following the steps you should perform after cloning this template repository:

1. execute init.sh
2. adjust/check the TODO in this file
3. Enable discussions in the settings =>
   General => [Discussions](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/settings#discussions-feature)
4. add a [new discussion category](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/discussions/categories/new)
   - icon: (click on icon) search for `computer` and choose the üíª (laptop) 
   - Category name: `Contributor Q&A`
   - Description: `Ask other contributors for help`
   - Discussion Format: Question / Answer (should already be preselected)
5. if you are
   -  a member of tegonal:   
      in order that the tegonal-bot pushes changes to its own fork (e.g. when executing cleanup.yml or gt-update.yml --
      see below for an explanation) and then create a normal PR you need to:
         1. [add the repository variable](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/settings/variables/actions/new)
          `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` with value tegonal-bot/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB
         2. login as tegonal-bot and then [fork the repository](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/fork)
   - not a member of tegonal:
     1. Follow the guidelines in [gt -> GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/tegonal/gt?tab=readme-ov-file#github-workflow) 
        to set up PUBLIC_GPG_KEYS_WE_TRUST (see next points for AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME and co.)
     2. Variables and secrets
         - either ask tegonal-bot to also push changes for your repository by [creating an issue](https://github.com/tegonal-bot/bot/issues/new?title=gt%20updates%20via%20tegonal-bot%20for%20...)
            1. [add the repository variable](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/settings/variables/actions/new)
			   `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` with value tegonal-bot/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB
             2. you will also get a token, [add it as secret to the repository](https://github.com/tegonal/cohiva/settings/secrets/actions/new)
                with name `AUTO_PR_TOKEN` (or as organisation secret so that you can share it between multiple projects)
         - use another user and correspondingly another fork:
            1. [add the repository variable](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/settings/variables/actions/new)
			   `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` with value which points to the fork something like `my-user/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB`
            2. create a personal access token
            3. [add it as secret to the repository](https://github.com/tegonal/cohiva/settings/secrets/actions/new)
			   with name `AUTO_PR_TOKEN`.

6. Following a short introduction in the scripts already setup in this repository:
	1. before-pr.sh is executed in .github/workflows/quality-assurance.yml
	   it currently executes scripts/cleanup-on-push-to-main.sh and scripts/run-shellcheck.sh
	   and should be extended by project specific tasks such as `sbt versionPolicyCheck` (e.g. in a scala project)
	2. cleanup-on-push-to-main.sh is executed in .github/workflows/cleanup.yml and is meant to cleanup after a PR.
	   => put commands such as code formatting in it, code generation which is committed etc.
	3. run-shellcheck.sh checks that shellcheck doesn't find issues in scripts located in the scripts directory

7. Following a short introduction in the workflows already setup in this repository:
	1. cleanup.yml => run after push on main and intended to cleanup after a PR.
	2. gt-update.yml => run periodically, updates all files pulled in via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt). Note, this workflow is disabled 
       automatically after 60 days of inactivity in your repository.
	3. quality-assurance.yml => run for PR and pushes, checks that the code/script quality and such are ok and no TODOs
	   are left open
	   => you will typically add more jobs which run tests (sbt test or gradle build)

8. As last step, delete this section (including the TODO below) and you are ready to start with your new OSS project  
   ps: use something like `git commit -a -m "initialised"`

TODO #4 delete the above
